# School-Python-Codes
The Python scripts I created while at school. The original scripts were coded in Python 2.7; however, I re-did theose programs in Python 3.

The following are the questions, and their codes:

1. Create a program that inputs a list, and converts it to a lower-triangular matrix with the ith element in the list as the ith column elements of the lower-triangular matrix. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Convert%20List%20to%20Lower%20Triangular%20Matrix.ipynb).

1. Create a program that inputs a string, displays the string, finds the number of words that start with t/T, reverses the third word, and joins the given string with a new string (also input by the user). [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/String%20input%2C%20display%2C%20count%20words%20starting%20with%20t%2C%20reverse%20third%20word%2C%20join%20with%20another%20string.ipynb).

1. Create a program that creates a matrix using user input, displays it, displays its above-major diagonal elements, below-major diagonal elements, above-minor diagonal elements, below-minor diagonal elements, major diagonal elements, and minor diagonal elements. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Matrix%20Input%20Display%20(Above(Below)%20Major(Minor)%20Diagonal)%20Elements.ipynb).

1. Create a program that inputs a string, and displays the frequency and percentage of occurance of an alphanumeric character in that string. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Frequecy%20and%20percentage%20of%20alphanumeric%20characters%20in%20a%20string.ipynb).

1. Create a program that counts the number of alphabets, and alphanumeric characters in a user-input string. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Number%20of%20alphabets%20and%20alphanumeric%20characters%20in%20a%20string.ipynb).

1. Create a program that asks the user to input a list if integers, displays it, and sorts only the positive integers in the list (without affecting the negative and 0 numbers).
[Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Sort%20positive%20numbers%20of%20a%20list.ipynb).

1. Create a program that asks the user to input a list of integers, displays it, checks if it is already in ascending/descending order, and counts the number of odd and even numbers in it. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/List%20check%20its%20order%20and%20count%20number%20of%20odd%20and%20even%20numbers.ipynb).

1. Create a prorgam that allows different users to vote for a political party, and at the end counts the number of votes each party has got, and displays that name of the winning party. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Election%20Simulation.ipynb).

1. Create a program that asks the user to input two matrices, display them, add and multiply them. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Add%20and%20Multiply%20Matricies.ipynb).

1. Create a program that checks if a number is an Armstrong Number or not. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Armstrong%20Number.ipynb).

1. Create a program that asks the user to input a string, display it and its length, converts its lowercase alphabets to uppercase and stores it in another variable (that variable should only include the lowercase converted to uppercase) and displays it, and converts its uppercase alphabets to lowercase and stores it in another variable(that variable should only include the uppercase converted to lowercase) and displays it. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Display%20string%20and%20length%20of%20converted%20lphabet%20case%20from%20user%20input%20string%20.ipynb).

1. Create a program (without using try and except clauses) that asks a users for their first name, last name, and phone numbers, and checks is the the given inputs are in valid format. If they are in valid format, display the person's full name and phone number, else ask them to re-enter a valid name/number. (Give the user a maximum of 9999 tries to re-enter). [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Enter%20valid%20name%20and%20phone%20number.ipynb).

1. Create a program that prints the Fibonacci sequence with a given number of terms. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Fibonacci%20Series.ipynb).

1. Create a program that asks the user to input a square matrix, display it, interchange its first and last column, interchange its first and last row, and interchange its major and minor diagonal elements. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Input%20square%20matrix%2C%20interchange%20first%20and%20last%20rows%20and%20cloumns%2C%20interchange%20diagonal%20elements.ipynb).

1. Create a program that asks a user to input a list with even number of elements, display it, switch positions of the odd/even index with its adjacent even/odd indexed number, and find the sum of odd and even digits. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/list%20alternate%20odd%20even%20index%2C%20sum%20of%20odd%20even%20digits.ipynb).

1. Create a program that asks the user to input a matrix, display is, calculates the sum of each row and column, finds the sum of major diagonal elements, minor elements, and all elements. Also, it must display the elements above and below the major and minor diagonal, the outline matrix, the middle row and column, the major and minor diagonals. Also, it must display the even elements only, find their count and sum. Also, it must display the odd elements only, find their count and sum. It must also display the transposed matrix, the product of both diagonal elements, and display swapped 1st and last row and column. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Matrix%20huge.ipynb).

1. Create a program that creates the following patterns given user input. See solution for the different patterns. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Patterns.ipynb).

1. Create a program that creates a phonebook dictionary with user input names stored as the keys and their phone numbers as their values. The program must also display all records, and delete a particular record asked by the user to delete. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Phonebook%20DIctionary%20Example.ipynb).

1. Create a program that displays all prime numbers between two numbers input by a user (both inclusive). [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Prime%20number%20between%20imput%20range.ipynb).

1. Create a program that inputs student marks, sorts them in ascending order, and searches for a particular mark and its position. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Sort%20student%20marks%20and%20search%20for%20them.ipynb).

1. Create a program that asks the user to input a string, check if it is a palindrome, count the number of words in it, and count the number of lowercase and uppercase alphabets in it. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/String%20number%20of%20words%2C%20palindrome%2C%20uppercase%20and%20lowercase%20alphabets.ipynb).

1. Create a program that asks the user to input a number n, and finds the sum of the given series. Also, check if the sum is likely to converge or not. See solution for the different series. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Sum%20of%20series.ipynb).

1. Other programs (not so important). Check solutions for details. [Solution](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Other%20programs.ipynb).
