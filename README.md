# School-Python-Codes
The Python scripts I created while at school. The original scripts were coded in Python 2.7; however, I re-did theose programs in Python 3.

The following are the questions, and their codes:

1. Create a program that inputs a list, and converts it to a lower-triangular matrix with the ith element in the list as the ith column elements of the lower-triangular matrix. [Answer](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Convert%20List%20to%20Lower%20Triangular%20Matrix.ipynb).

1. Create a program that inputs a string, displays the string, finds the number of words that start with t/T, reverses the third word, and joins the given string with a new string (also input by the user). [Answer](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/String%201.ipynb).
