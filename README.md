# School-Python-Codes
The Python scripts I created while at school. The original scripts were coded in Python 2.7; however, I re-did theose programs in Python 3.

The following are the questions, and their codes:

1. Create a program that inputs a list, and converts it to a lower-triangular matrix with the ith element in the list as the ith column elements of the lower-triangular matrix. [Answer](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Convert%20List%20to%20Lower%20Triangular%20Matrix.ipynb).

1. Create a program that inputs a string, displays the string, finds the number of words that start with t/T, reverses the third word, and joins the given string with a new string (also input by the user). [Answer](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/String%20input%2C%20display%2C%20count%20words%20starting%20with%20t%2C%20reverse%20third%20word%2C%20join%20with%20another%20string.ipynb).

1. Create a program that creates a matrix using user input, displays it, displays its above-major diagonal elements, below-major diagonal elements, above-minor diagonal elements, below-minor diagonal elements, major diagonal elements, and minor diagonal elements. [Answer](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Matrix%20Input%20Display%20(Above(Below)%20Major(Minor)%20Diagonal)%20Elements.ipynb).

1. Create a program that inputs a string, and displays the frequency and percentage of occurance of an alphanumeric character in that string. [Answer](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Frequecy%20and%20percentage%20of%20alphanumeric%20characters%20in%20a%20string.ipynb).

1. Create a program that counts the number of alphabets, and alphanumeric characters in a user-input string. [Answer](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Number%20of%20alphabets%20and%20alphanumeric%20characters%20in%20a%20string.ipynb).

1. Create a program that finds the area of a triangle using Heron's formula. [Answer](https://github.com/Parv-Joshi/School-Python-Codes/blob/main/Herons%20Formula.ipynb).
